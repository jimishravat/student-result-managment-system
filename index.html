            <p>
                Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering College was established in 1948 from donations made by the
                Birla Education Trust on the behest of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Home Minister of independent
                India. The college was inaugurated by Lord Mountbatten, the Governor General of India on 14 June 1948,
                and rose to prominence under the stewardship of Prof. Junarkar and Prof. K.M. Dholakia. It was one of
                the first few colleges in India that adopted the progressive credit system of relative grading in India.
                The college has awarded degrees to over 17,000 graduates, and has its alumni spread across the globe</p>
